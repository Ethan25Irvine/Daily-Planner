set up the timer with jquery
create a div to input our current day

create a card that will hold our scheadule 
    -timwe block is from 7 am - 10 pm 
    -have seperate rows/divs in that container 
    -make an area that people can type inside the <p> or whatever it ends up being (you might have to create the html via logic but I could     be wrong)
    -Have save buttons next to those lines that will save the text inside of the blank html
    
Logic for the time moving accordingly via the colors that declare past/present/future times/events (gotta be around these lines i hope)
    -if($('.scheaduleTimes)===current time){
        bg-color === $('.present);
    } else if ($('.scheaduleTimes)=== (somehow get it to be future time)){
        bg-color === $('.future);
    } else if {
        bg-color === $('.past);
    }
    set default to current 
Logic for the save button 
Logic for the save button 

Logic for the time so that everything resets at 10 pm
